title: "Performans Platform Lublin"
---
The action took place during the three-day festival Performance Platform Lublin. It was a direct result of the 4-day workshop that preceded the festival.

In this action I took up the theme of what is hidden and invisible. A few metres of woollen cord wrapped meticulously around my calf. Six meters of tape hidden on the smallest toe. A few lemons in a linen bag. The red outfit as a symbol of courage and determination, passion, but also anger.The action was determined by the multi-layered symbolism of the used objects.  I am eating a lemon, a symbol of betrayal.
