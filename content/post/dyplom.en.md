title: "Migration of identity relative to the time and the place"
---

Movement of your identity in time and space – a vague look at stages of life and a response to your new situation and daily movements. Giving new weights, creating new stages and new reference points. Pursuit and struggle – the principal subject of the work. I confront adversities and limitations constantly – in this case they are, among others, clothing and space. Feet traces on the ground constitute a record of the battle. The art activity shows the process of winning and appropriating everything that is on the way toward the aim.
