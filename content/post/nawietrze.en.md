title: "Na wietrze spokojne stają się głowy"

Two forces that manifest dynamics that are different from each other and the way it is expressed. Both are directed, both in a different direction, both are defined. Enclosed in the circle - a symbol of completeness, harmony, balance and precision, where the young grass injects all its force into defining itself upwards, it creeps directed towards growth. In the representation of the reed we have the locked appearance of a dead object, but it is as dead as the viewer perceives it to be. The tremendous dynamics inherent in this closed form, derived from external factors, shapes an extremely powerful image. Forms arguing visually, yet treating about the same thing. Coexisting with each other, they give an image of harmony and diversity in one.

*"Did she have before her eyes a vision of flies, or wheelbarrows, or a fairy kingdom hidden behind the far end of the hedge? - pondered Mrs. Ramsay; or was she rushing thus for the sheer delight of running? No one knew."*- To the Lighthouse, Virginia Woolf
