 The performance took place in a small square where there was already a boulder – the last element of the performance. Firstly, a mound from pebbles was piled, raising it happened in front of the spectators. Then, there were located two other stones in a row, and the row was ended with the boulder. At each stage (new stage – new stone), fitting happened. Fitting the body to different forms of ‘stages’.  

 At each stage there was an attempt to maintain the balance. Maintaining a stable position on uneven rocks bordered on miraculous, and each time ended with failure. The last part of the path was the boulder lay in the end of line. The first part of the final stage was putting the pebbles from the heap around the boulder. Then, after exchanging glances with each of the spectators, the final part took place. The victory pose was determined, dominance over the final stage. After a moment of being in that position, where one leg rested on the ground and the other on the boulder, I removed a knife from a loop in my trousers and placed it on a boulder. All stages have been completed. Formation of the body in the form of existing forms turned out to be inefficient. The final road, though, ended with the victory.
