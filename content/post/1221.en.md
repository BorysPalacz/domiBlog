The experience of not being able to use the known functions of objects, enclosed in the form of a ping-pong table. A compositional arrangement created to present the contradictions that accompany the presentation of an a-functional element used in a game. The objects - both the table with a net and the paddles - differ from their function. The work is interactive, the viewer can test for themselves what problem the subject of this work is facing. A simple game, which everyone had to deal with at school, is an indicator of a flawed attempt to play it, i.e. to face something commonly known and simple to use. The absurdity of this helplessness is hidden in the deconstruction of objects
