title: "Sleepy in Between"
---
Sleepy in Between is a vague memory of a train trip, an echo of a moment, a train hallucinogen. An excerpt from my notes under a sketch of that trip proclaims: "the fog is beautiful, it does not cover, the fog wraps / it is not a silent silence". I find situations in everyday life that make my gaze pause, the background flatten. I stare enchanted at a situation that makes no sense but somehow grabs me. When the train cables made a throttling sound every now and then, and little flecks of fuzz came out of their innards, my gaze hung with interest. I am puzzled by the moments when we lose track of time and our focus takes over. Sleepy in between  is not a recreation to a train situation, but a depiction of the state in the head and body when we focus on an individual thing so much that we as a subject disappear.
