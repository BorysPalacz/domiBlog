title: "The invisibility cloak"
---

*The invisibility cloak* is a work that was created in 2020. It is a ready-made object sewn from multiple coats, the idea of which is to intensify the effect of the trench coat - an element of clothing identified with lurking, watching, as well as with clever avoidance or blending into an image indistinguishable to the eye. By multiplying all the coats she owns, Dominika symbolically increases its causative powers. The work is inspired by the cultural symbolism of coats, mixed with the artist's individual preferences and needs. The object, which draws on its diversified character - on the borderline between artistic fabric-sculpture and clothing element - may function in various ways. The work, as in the vast majority of Dominika's work, is based on themes made up of her own concerns and needs. However, through the multifunctionality of the object, it gives space for the viewer to identify with the narrative in which the object is embedded.

Her seemingly individual and personalized subject works, crave social engagement. The work is interactive and community-based in that the viewer, while in the presence of the object, can enter into a relationship with it by wearing the sheet. In this way, Dominika seeks to translate her own stories into something of social value. 

The sheet spread on the wall is like the skin of a precious animal, a trophy stripped from the individual. It is a bit of a stripping away of that which protects (_here_ artist) and allows one to simply function. Such skin artifacts are also ascribed a signifier of a certain power - here we are, we have what binds the individual together, we have stripped them of that, so they remain defenseless and/or doomed to be executed. It literally renders that which protects it from the outside.The motif of putting the artist in the hands of the audience is manifested in this work; she condemns herself to vulnerability and puts herself in a position where she sheds her protective patches. 

When we treat the work as everyday clothing we in a way enter into the skin of the artist.
