 When we want to describe everything but we are short of breath. Brisk and sudden descriptions of events, which in their charm close everything and give consent to everything – the form is not able to close itself.

 A collection of drawings, texts and objects that are based on *noticing*. The praise for everyday life and its aura. Many sketches that are a record of waking and sleeping. Transferring images that appeared in moments of the greatest relaxation to paper – nightmares. The absurd images interweave with weighty daydreams. On the exhibition you could see ‘Blue Almonds and a Dream About a Boy’, ‘A Safe Car’ as well as reliefs ‘1001 trinkets’, ‘4th place’, ‘Wild strawberries agitation’ and a set of three reliefs representing a form of visual poetry. A large part of the exhibition was composed of texts. The works can be described as ‘warm nostalgia’.
