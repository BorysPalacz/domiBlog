title: "Bans are nothing"

Action dictated by the presence of ubiquitous plants located in the area of decommissioned power plant in Pionki, Poland. The idea came from my admiration for the vegetation that had chosen this space - industrial halls, stark-looking squares mostly covered with lumps of coal. In addition, all around the site of the power plant we could see a warning tape which warned of danger. But all bans means nothing to nature, it is superior to them.
