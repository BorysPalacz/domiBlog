---
A *ready-made* work using a replica of wallpaper, and elements of a hammock. The work deals with abstract observation that occurs in moments of deepened attention. In this case, the artist focuses on the elements of her own room. Excerpt from the note from the exhibition where the work was presented: "Her (Dominika Gierszewska's) works also refer to " lost times", "unnoticed times". - hallucinations. We are hallucinated by her with objects of everyday use. Instead of using - we look and we are enchanted. In her works, Gierszewska uses the wallpaper that will warm up even the cold souls. The material is artificially warm, yellowish - an artificial creation. Its apparent softness encourages us to stay with it.
