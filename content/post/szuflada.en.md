In fact, the work explains itself with its title, and the text form written on the inside of the pocket can be treated as a complementary title. They both direct the viewer's attention to the drawer, which we can jump into and flatten ourselves in. 


A run around the room,

30 minutes of rest,

hole in the drawer.

Beige coat,

long.

Sweeping movements.

A beam of a smile

Lights up the hearts of passersby.

The fluffy flippers.

You settle into a drawer,

a trigger.
