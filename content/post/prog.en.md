A dreamy ready-made installation, consisting of a door frame and door thresholds in multiplied numbers. In a cartoonish and ephemeral way, these elements focus attention on their functions, which remain unconscious the vast majority of the time. Concentration therefore falls on objects that are not necessarily considered in-day-to-day-life. Abstracted, however, they speak loudly about their 'transitional' (we have to go through them) nature, and the fact that they observe human decision-making in entering and/or leaving. The work deals with the sweeping step we have to take to cross the door sill, but also with the situation when we decide to cross the threshold, but it is mercilessly prolonged. It is an expression of the fear that accompanies crossing a door sill, e.g. a house, when we are afraid to confront what is outside, although there may be many readings of this object due to the swinging motion it offers.
