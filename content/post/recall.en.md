title: "and I recall. 2:1"
---
A quasi-poetic collection of poems and texts in which the main themes are a garbage truck, men from below the block, ghosts, the inaccessibility of block reality, a strangely familiar face as if from a kinder bueno wrapper or faces in floor panels. 

This zine was created as a complementary form for the object works included in the exhibition and I recall. 2:1 organized in November 2019 at Scena Otwarta in Poznan. It is a collection of texts and sketches that are reflections on everyday life. It was presented at the post-festival exhibition ZINFEST// Zines and artbook fair organized by Bomba Publishing House in November '19.
