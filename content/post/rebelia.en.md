title: "Rebellion Manifesto"

An innocence act on a world scale, rebellion, breaking the rules, can be the biggest act of braveness for individual aka organ doing the offense. Work itself it 6 m long wallpaper on which the technical drawings were drew - more or less imaginary.  For the wider public, worldwide or when we put it in context of other rebellion acts/ gestures, drawing on the wallpaper is an irrelevant, indifferent act. However, would many of us dare to draw on the wallpaper? How hard is it to break into the act of courage, especially in the zones that are close for us and we know them really well? Almost in every honoured and papered home there is a respect to wallpaper. Do not hammer a nail, don't draw, do not stain the walls, do not lean on the wall, .Wallpaper is something different than painted walls. We feel inner respect.

About the imperceptible to the outside world rebellion in everyday life, about small steps for better tomorrow.
