<br>
<br>
Dominika's field of interest revolves around small and close to her topics - closeness is inscribed in individual receptors. She focuses on describing
topics left behind by its blandness. As a&nbsp;visual artist, makes them visible, and at the same time asks about perception: what and why we see. She
seeks for truth in her own and social observations, considering where our own truth begins and ends in seeing and perceiving reality. She creates an
observer of your perception.

<br>
What do we choose to look at and why?
<br>
<br>
Dominika is in the process of seeking the truth about things. The truth that she tries to find using her objects. Through the process of taming and
watching, she sees mental deception in perception.
